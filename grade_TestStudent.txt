Everything in comic book movies make say \"\"wtf was that, why no just do that, or why not just avoid that, why does she have to talk like that, why not just speak like a normal person\"\" In the dark knight every scene is like a poem. The scenes tough scenes are so intense . the funny scenes are funny. the sad scenes are funny, I re-watched the dark knight rises the other day. And i almost cried at the end. Why cant other comic book movies have the same type of effect. why cant i care about spiderman not having a father or man of steel. My point is....I hate turning off my brain to enjoy a movies.. I watched the winter solder yesterday. I skipped almost every scene. Its like wow,,, did i not see this same scene in spiderman, or iron man. I hate watching a movie and keep asking myself why the characters are doing what they are doing. There is no purpose for the hero to save people. He just does it because the script says \"\"then the hero returns to save the world\"\" I am jumping off the point. ps I know I will get a lot of hate from this,,,, I always do. its rare to find other people who look at movies different. They all give me the same response. \"\"its just a movie\"\" the only comic book movies I would be happy to defend are - the dark knight trilogy, days of future past, and the old spiderman.

That's like saying \"\"Whites enslaved the blacks, so lets have the blacks enslave the whites.\"\" Slavery was abolished because it was IMMORAL and despite enforcing it, having whites enslaved under blacks would have made little sense. I find this similar to inequality in the legal system where some women argue that men are \"\"deserving\"\" of the injustices dealt to them by the system because of past injustices by men to women. If we instituted our entire legal system on \"\"an eye for an eye\"\", the \"\"egalitarian\"\" system many western nations claim to have would be laughable at best. Seriously, let's forget the past, learn from our mistakes, and fix the present. There is no sense in causing more inequalities."}
